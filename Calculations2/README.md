# calc_daltons.py

This program calculates the average molecualr weight of PKC Beta-1 in kilodaltons. 

## Description

This python program gives an average molecular weight for the _Rattus norvegicus_ PKC Beta-1 protein. The protein sequence for PKC Beta-1 is hard-coded into this program. The number of amino acids is calculated from this sequence to determine the average molecular weight of 110 Daltons per amino acid. This is then converted from Daltons to give the molecular weight of the PKC Beta-1 protein sequnce in kilodaltons. 


# calc_number_amino_acids.py

This program calculates the average molecular weight of a user inputted gene in kilodaltons. 

## Description

This python program asks a user for a gene name and the number of nucleotides in its coding sequnce. The program then calculates the number of amino acids that are in the gene's nucleotide sequence. If the user inputs a nucleotide sequence that is not divisible by 3, then an ERROR message pops up to tell the user to input a correct nucleotide sequence number. If the nucleotide sequence is divisible by 3, then the number of nucleotides, the number of amino acids, and the average molecular weight of the calculated amino acid sequence in kilodaltons will be prited out to the user.


# dynamic_protocol.py

This program calculates the volumes that are needed to make a solution given the final volume and concentrations. 

## Description

This python program asks a user for the desired final volume of the solution (mL), NaCl stock concentration (mM), NaCl final concentration (mM), MgCl2 stock concemtration (mM), and MgCl2 final concentration (mM). From this inputted information, the program will print out the volumes needed to make the desired solution in mL NaCl, mL MgCl2, and mL water to reach the final volume.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
